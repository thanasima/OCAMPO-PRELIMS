                    <p id="story">
                        Considered a genius due to having the highest grades in the country, 
                        Miyuki Shirogane leads the prestigious Shuchiin Academy's student council as 
                        its president, working alongside the beautiful and wealthy vice president 
                        Kaguya Shinomiya. The two are often regarded as the perfect couple by students 
                        despite them not being in any sort of romantic relationship. However, the truth is 
                        that after spending so much time together, the two have developed feelings for one 
                        another; unfortunately, neither is willing to confess, as doing so would be a sign 
                        of weakness. With their pride as elite students on the line, Miyuki and Kaguya embark
                        on a quest to do whatever is necessary to get a confession out of the other. 
                        Through their daily antics, the battle of love begins!

                    <h2>My Favorite is Chika Fujiwara</h2>
                    <p id="p1">
                        Chika is based on Kuramochi no Miko, 
                        the second suitor from The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter who was tasked with
                        finding the Jeweled Branch from Hourai. Her habit of cheating during games 
                        is based on the fact that her counterpart attempted to present Princess Kaguya 
                        with a forgery. Everyone in her family has plant-based names that reference the branch 
                        in some way.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p2">
                        Chika's surname "Fujiwara" is based on the actual real-life Fujiwara clan 
                        who were important figures in Japanese Politics throughout history.
